Enterprise Java: Fall 2021 - Individual Project - Problem Statements/User Stories

PROJECT NAME: The Concept Compendium


PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
The purpose of this application is to allow the creation, recording and iteration of ideas and concepts for writers and creators in a more organized and fluid level. 

DETAILS AND WORKFLOW:
The use of paper notes and books to contain ideas such as these does work, but these methods make referencing older ideas and comparing ideas against one another in real time somewhat clumsy and difficult. This application attempts to solve those problems. The application is going to provide a place for users to record ideas in their most raw form. Beyond that, the application will allow users to pull all of these ideas together based on common traits or on very specific unique ones that will allow these ideas to be reviewed, updated and cross referenced with one another. Having such control over these cataloged ideas will allow creators to provide further expansion on certain ideas when needed, as well as provide a framework to avoid excessive repetition. 


ADDITONAL ITEMS:  Screenshot ideas for The Concept Compendium


USER STORIES:

1. As a user of the Concept Compendium I need to be able to record all of my ideas in a secure place:
	- The application will contain different accounts for users to keep their ideas and concepts safe from unwelcome eyes.  
	

2. As a user of the Concept Compendium I need to be able to see my ideas in simple collections:
	- The application will allow users to review all of their ideas based on several criteria that are controlled by the user. 
	These criteria will be: 
	  
		1. Category (set idea categories that exist within the application).	  
		2. Keywords (unique descriptors created by the users).	  
	    3. Genre. [Stretch Goal - will not be in this iteration of the project].
	  

3. As a user of the Concept Compendium I need to be able to pull up these ideas easily (I cannot have any get "lost"):
	- Users can search for ideas based on several values and attributes that tie to each entry. 
	- The end result will be that no ideas that are submitted will end up "lost".
	- If the user can recall anything about it, that idea will be able to be found. 
	- A view all listing will be available for these ideas. 
	

4. As a user of the Concept Compendium I need to be able to update my ideas:
	- The application will allow for all submitted ideas to be able to be reviewed at any time. 
	- Wholesale changes or minimal updates will all be allowed.
	

5. As a user of the Concept Compendium I need to be able to remove ideas completely:
	- The application will allow for ideas to be deleted and removed from the application with no adverse effects on any ideas that remain.


6. As a user of the Concept Compendium I would like to be able to see counts of my ideas:
	- The application will contain the ability to see counts for various ideas in:  
	    1. Grand total throughout the entire application.		
		2. Totals in selected categories within the application.
		3. Group totals in selected genres. [This is a stretch goal]
	  

7. As a user of the Concept Compendium I would like to have an account:
	- The application will require a sign up for an account to be able to use it.
	
	
8. As a user of the Concept Compendium I would like to be able to log in:
	- The application will require a log in to the account to be able to create and catalog ideas.


9. As a user of the Concept Compendium I would like to be able to log out:
	- The application will allow users to log out after a session.


10. As a user of the Concept Compendium I would like to have protection for my ideas against unspecified access/tampering: 
	- The application will allow for different levels of access to the catalog to protect the contents. 
	- All of these levels require an account in the application.
		1. Ideation Level: Users at this level can create, update and delete their own ideas in the application.  
		2. Inspection Level: Users at this level can only view ideas in the application. 


11. As a user of the Concept Compendium I would like to be able to have Admin rights:   
	[Stretch Goal - will not be in this iteration of the project].
	
	- The application will allow for another high level of access to the catalog. 
	- There will now be an Administrator Level that can access all user accounts in the application. 
	- This level can create, update and delete ideas throughout the application.
