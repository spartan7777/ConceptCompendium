**ACCOMPLISHMENTS:** Had to go back and review the Week 2 videos and Week 3 videos. This included the walkthroughs provided by the instructor in order to properly review these topics that I
feel comfortable with. Continued to review my files and items for my individual project - The Concept Compendium. Found I still had a lot of valid materials from my last 
attempt that could be re-worked and updated into a good basis for a complete project and a good submission for Checkpoint 1. I was able to rework the project plan, problem 
statement and the user Stores so that they were more presentable in markdown. I found the markdown editor in IntelliJ to be a great resource for this. I was also able to 
get the Concept Compendium on the student list for individual projects in the Organizations page in Git. 


**SETBACKS:** The idea was to start coding for the Concept Compendium after getting Checkpoint 1 materials ready, but that was not going to be the case. I had a lot of unexpected issues
with Ubuntu and/or my computer along with some hiccups thrown in there by Git. I can no longer use a password for Git and needed to create a Personal Access Token. This was
not too hard to do, but I was unable to use it to get anything done, or even be able to change my credentials because I could not copy of paste anything during my work
session. I am not sure if this is due to updates or because I am using a wireless keyboard, but I could not copy or paste any url or any other data at all. I may need to
find a wired keyboard. I was also unable to do any cloning through IntelliJ for Git repositories and the like. I will try to get this handled as soon as possible. 
I ended up needing to re-download and reinstall the VM onto my machine. It worked, but at this time I have not made any updates top is as I do not know if that will cause 
the same issues to pop back up again. I will need to check in and see if I can avoid the updates this time. 


**NEXT WEEK'S PLAN:** Complete the Week 4 videos on time and start on the Week 4 assignments and exercises. Start working on the database creating and other deeper coding for The Concept 
Compendium.
