**ACCOMPLISHMENTS:** Made a lot of progress towards getting all the necessary materials into my project for Checkpoint 2. This included adding in a generic DAO for both the production and test
classes for the application. Continued to work on the generic DAO for the project and added in all unit testing as needed. There were still some issues that needed to be
worked out but the code was all in place and I had no errors in the code from Hibernate. Was able to see some other student projects and where these were for Checkpoint
2. Seeing their progress gave me a lot of confidence. This point in time is where things fell off the rails for me last time. A lot of this was due to my having to 
basically drop everything leaving me no time to work on things, but I was also struggling to get the DAOs to work, and that was a bit defeating. I feel like seeing this 
done in real time (and not through an example in a course video) gives me some hope that I can make this work as well. 


**SETBACKS:** I am working to make sure that I can get caught up as needed and get all of the required materials ready and in place for Checkpoint 2. I lost a lot of time this  
weekend. The main setback continues to be how much time I have lost, but I will get things caught up on that. I lost some time this weekend taking care of family, so I will
need to take some time away from everyone and everything this upcoming week to make sure I can get close to completing Checkpoint 2 as well as move towards adding in other  
materials from Week 6 and Week 7.
