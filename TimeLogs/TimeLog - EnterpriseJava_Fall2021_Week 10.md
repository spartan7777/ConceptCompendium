**ACCOMPLISHMENTS:** Continue to work on the Professional Development Activity on Project Ghidra. The entire project is done and is ready for presentation on 11/10. 
Continue to utilize the readings and the examples I had to make more advances on the Concept Compendium. Created several controllers that I feel make sense. 
Working on getting my AWS account ready, building a database in AWS, and loading the Concept Compendium into it. Made some progress towards getting everything ready for
Checkpoint 3.	

Attended the second team meeting for the Team Project. 
	- Fleshed out what the project is going to do.
	- Had further discussions about what the project is and is not going to need to be.
	- Further division of labor was discussed 

From all of this, it seems as though I became the team leader without really asking for that role. I also took on the role of the team record keeper. With there being some
uncertainty about what we supposed to build (we kept leaning towards building an app) we made sure that we would have another meeting during class time to discuss the project
along with guidance from the instructor. In that meeting, it was determined that I had led the team a bit off base, and that we needed to review the materials for Week 8 and
Week 9 in order to better understand the Rest API concept. I was able to do that, and while it is still a bit fuzzy (in that I keep thinking we need to develop the landing page
for using this) I do understand the core concepts involved here. I set out working on getting this established for the team in order to see what we need to do, and how we can
get it all to come together. 



**SETBACKS:** While I spent a lot of time on course work this week, and much of it was geared towards the Professional Development Activity and the Team Project. 
This took a lot of time away from working on getting my project ready to get over to Checkpoint 3 ready which is already late as it is. The Team project is also taking 
time away from working on that project as well. Some errors I got during unit testing required me to have to go back and rebuild the database, and several methods in the DAOs,
but this was not too difficult to do and was eventually taken care of. The biggest setback I feel that occurred this week was with the team project. 
I felt I led the team astray in understanding the purpose of the project. Also, while the team has not really voted on or decided who the leader would be - I may have 
stepped into that role by accident, and I could now be the de facto leader at this point, While I am not shying away from such responsibility, I feel that my lack of really
understanding APIs (simply where they exist since there is no real app involved here) is troubling to me. My only recourse is to work as hard as I can to make up for the
missteps that have already occurred whether those are my fault or not. To me, that is what a leader does - elected or not. This could lead to another additional time crunch 
for me, so I need to do as much as possible to make things work for everyone.
