**ACCOMPLISHMENTS:** Having to switch gears allowed me to make some real headway on my Professional Development Activity on Project Ghidra. I was able to gather all the
resources that I need to use and began work on the written report to be the basis of the presentation for the project. I was also able to get a little work done on the
PowerPoint files that will support the written report as well. 

Was able to get back into the code for the Concept Compendium following some coaching and troubleshooting with the instructor during the class period time. Reworked the code and
completed full unit testing on the entity DOAs (User, Concept). Did additional work to get the final enitiy DAOs (Role, Category) coded, built and tested in the Concept
Compendium. Along with the database diagram, this step will be all that remains to complete all materials needed for Checkpoint 2, although it is all several weeks late. In
addition to this, I was able to watch and complete all videos and readings from Week 7.

The team project was started this week in class. Facilitated the first team meeting for the Team Project. The team was able to find a name (AegisBlue) and discussed many things
we needed that were required as deliverables. We were able to get an idea together for the project itself (a cybersecurity web service that counts zero-days), created the main
idea for the problem statement, set up the timetable for future meetings, and agreed upon a preliminary division of labor. I was able to get many items completed for the team
project. It fell to me to consolidate and complete the Team Resume, the Project Plan, the Team Charter, the Team Journal, and the Team Problem Statement and get all of these
materials submitted for review. 



**SETBACKS:** I was enlightened during my troubleshooting session on how some of the basics that should be second nature for me are a struggle as it has been a very long time
since I complete the Advanced Java course. That said, once I began to see these things that were missing start to manifest themselves in my code - it became easier to fix the
DAOs and the entities that I created and to complete the coding for the others that were not yet done. At this point, the major setback I have, once againâ€¦is time. I need to
find more time to catch up on what I am missing or become more efficient with the time that I must make this all work and get some success on this project. Now, with my
Professional Development Activity coming due in the next week, and the team project now being added on top of all of that I will need to find very creative ways to get things
done as not having enough time cannot really be a viable reason for setbacks any longer. There are only seven weeks or so left to complete this course, and I must make it a
successful journey.
