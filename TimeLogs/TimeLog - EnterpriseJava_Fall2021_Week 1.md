#### Enterprise Java Fall 2021: Weekly Reflection

#### Week 1
#### 8/25/2021 - 9/1/2021 - *8 Hours*


#### RELEVANT ITEMS:
1. Completed the Course Set Up and Upgrade for the VMWare Workstation
2. Completed the Course Set Up and Upgrade for Ubuntu
3. Completed the Course Set Up and Upgrade for IntelliJ
4. Watched All Week 1 Videos
5. Started thinking on the scope of the Individual Project
6. Started thinking on the topic for the Professional Development Activity


**ACCOMPLISHMENTS:** Completed the course set up but did have some major issues. I did overcome those issues and was able to get most of the set up completed little trouble after some research
and a new approach. Watched all the Week 1 videos. Started to review my files and items for my individual project - The Concept Compendium. It is my hope that I can propose 
this project one more time again for this semester and have a chance to complete it. This idea, and all that it encompasses has become more like a java education personal
mission for me than an assignment. I need to see this particular project through to the end and get this concept to grow from idea, to plan, to design, to actual 
functioning application.  


**SETBACKS:** Had some major issues completing the Ubuntu setup. I was not able to download the VMWare files for this semester's course. I had completed the set up using an older VM 
with the fear that if things did not go well, I would not be able to easily figure it out. This did happen as I got the low memory warning, and could not find the file in 
the video that was targeted as the cause of this issue. After some research, I found that I needed to adjust some settings in my antivirus software, and this allowed me to 
properly download the new fall 2021 VMWare course file. Once this was done, I completed the setup as outlined in the week one videos. 


**NEXT WEEK'S PLAN:** Complete the rest of the Week 1 set up videos and get IntelliJ set up for new projects. I also plan to connect to GitHub and pull down the proper files from there. I will
also create a new repository in Git for my projects and weekly assignments. I will propose the Concept Compendium as my individual project and if that is accepted, I will 
solidify the plans for that project so that I am getting ahead on that front. I will also propose some ideas for my Professional Development Activity and begin thinking on 
how to make the presentation a success. Then, it is onto Week 2 videos and assignments and try to have those completed before the next class period.
