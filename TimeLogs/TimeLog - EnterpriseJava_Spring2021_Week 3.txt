Week 3
2/2/2021 - 2/8/2021 - 9 hours


RELEVANT ITEMS:
1. Re-watched all Week 2 Videos
2. Worked through and completed the Week 2 Exercise
3. Started watching Week 3 Videos
4. Completed all Week 3 readings
5. Received some early feedback on my documentation for Checkpoint 1.
6. Used this feedback to update all the necessary documentation for the Individual Project Checkpoint 1


ACCOMPLISHMENTS:  
Had to go back and review the Week 2 videos. This included the walkthourgh provided by the instructor to help me see my way through the excerice. Started to work on watching all the Week 3 videos, and completed the readings. Started to review my files and items for my individual project - The Concept Compendium. Found I still had a lot of valid materials from my last attempt that could be re-wroked and consolidated into a good start for Checkpoint 1. Worked on getting this ready and submitted. Received some feedback on how to complete this docunmentation to the instructor's liking. Updated the documentation for Checkpoint 1 and submitted it.


SETBACKS:  
Time management once again has gotten me a little bit behind in the coursework. While the plan was to be completely done with all Week 3 activities and exercises in addition to the re-working of the Week 2 exercise, I was not able to do that due to some weather related family emergencies. That said, I will use this next coming week to complete all of Week 3's assignment materials and move into and try to complete all of Week 4's assignment materials as well.
