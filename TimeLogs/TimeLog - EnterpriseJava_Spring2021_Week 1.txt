Enterprise Java Spring 2021: Weekly Reflection - Time Logs

Week 1
1/19/2021 - 1/26/2021 - 8 hours


RELEVANT ITEMS:
1. Completed the Course Set Up
2. Watched All Week 1 Videos
3. Started working on Week 2 Videos
4. Started thinking on an Individual Project


ACCOMPLISHMENTS:  
Completed the course set up and had little trouble. Watches all the Week 1 videos, and started watching several of the week 2 videos. Started to review my files and items for my individual project - The Concept Compendium. It is my hope that I can propose this project again for this semester and have a chance to complete it. 


SETBACKS:  
Had some major issues completing the excercise. I may have mixed up some steps but i was not able to get the project to run as in the video. I recieved messages that I needed to "Please, configure Web Facet first!" and then got error messages in the code that indicated that "The import javax.servlet.annotation cannot be resolved." and I could not connect to Tomcat. These seemed to be serious issues that took a lot of time to research and try to troubleshoot. As usual, I could not find the answers I needed. I ended up correcting it by reloading the Maven Project, and this solved everything in one move. 


NEXT WEEK'S PLAN:
Complete the Week 2 assignments and exercises in class so that I have other students and the instructor as active resources should I need assistance. I will propose the Concept Compendium as my individual project and if that is accepted, I will solidify the plans for that project so that I am getting ahead on that front. I will then go onto Week 3 videos and assignments and try to have those completed before the next class period on February 2nd.
