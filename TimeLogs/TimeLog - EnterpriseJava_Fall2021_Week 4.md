#### Enterprise Java Fall 2021: Weekly Reflection

#### Week 4
#### 9/16/2021 - 9/22/2021 - *18 Hours*


#### RELEVANT ITEMS:
1. Watched all Week 3 videos
2. Completed all Week 3 readings
3. Worked through the Week 3 Exercise using the suggested solutions
4. Completed all Week 4 videos
5. Completed all Week 4 readings
6. Started work on the individual project database needs and structures
7. Picked my topic for the Professional Development Activity presentation and added that to Github


**ACCOMPLISHMENTS:** I got a lot taken care of in regard to going over materials that were very familiar to me, or that I needed some brushing up on. I completed viewing all the Week 3 videos.
This included the walkthrough provided by the instructor to take a very good look at the Week 3 exercise. Completed the work in viewing all the Week 4 videos, and completed 
the readings. Started to review my project plan for the Concept Compendium and began work on the database planning. I have designed all of the tables and columns for all of 
the data I believe I will need. I have also begun to create the necessary diagram for this database. 


**SETBACKS:** The VM is still not working as needed after update. I tried to fix the VMWare tools, and I was not able to extract certain files due to a lack of available disk space.
After reaching out on Slack, I was told to try some commands that did not seem to help. After all of that, the Install VMware Tools command in the VM was greyed out and 
would not allow me to even try to install the tools again. I am not sure if this was due to an incomplete attempt before this latest one, or what. The suggestions to fix 
this were a bit over my head, and I feared that I could do more damage than I can fix. I had to download and open an older copy of the VM once again, and will work with that
for as long as I can, and possibly get to next class period to see if these issues can be fixed. I am fortunate that a lot of the work I am doing now, does not seem to 
require an up to date VM.
