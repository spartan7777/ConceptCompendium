Week 8
3/8/2021 - 3/14/2021 - 52 hours


RELEVANT ITEMS:
1. Watched all Week 7 Videos
2. Completed all Week 7 Readings
3. Watched all Week 8 Videos
4. Completed all Week 8 Readings
5. Coded along with the Week 7 demo to complete the Week 7 exercise
6. Completed the deployment of the Week 7 exercise with Tomcat
7. Worked through more MVC and Java application building YouTube tutorials to gain a better understanding of how MVC works, and how to properly code my project. Worked on recoding my project from the ground up using some of the techniques that I found in these tutorials. 
8. Did some additional work on the slides and the visual components for my Professional Development Activity presentation on Amazon Lumberyard


ACCOMPLISHMENTS:  
Did a lot of research on MVC and java web application coding to see if I could find a thought process out there that I could really understand and take a lot of inspiration from. There were a lot of different methods out there, some were helpful and some were not. I did pick up some things about Helper Classes and found that I liked how they kept things a bit more segmented for me. It broke up the Controller a bit and made them a bit easier to grasp. I did some practice and tried some work with these to see if I could get them to work for me. 
Coded and studied along with several tutorial videos through YouTube.

Searched online for a better understanding of the Controller part of the MVC setup and found some additional notes. These did help me formulate a better understanding of what the controller does, and how to set one up. I also needed to do a little more research to find out about how to make a button launch the controller.

SETBACKS:  
I found myself struggling to get a real deep understanding of how the code for this application was going to work. I knew what I wanted it to do, and I knew for the most part where to put stuff, but I struggled with the why part of all of it. I knew how to figure out how to get that to work (or at least try to get it to make sense) but I found a major setback has been where that code goes, why it goes there and how to make sure it talks to all of the other pieces of my application. I am going to have to take a step back and really look at this. This may be a major setback as far as time goes - but I will have to find a way to make it work. There were some struggles with the Week 7 exercise as well, but only in that I failed to get a user to have their admin rights recognized and was not able to figure out why.
