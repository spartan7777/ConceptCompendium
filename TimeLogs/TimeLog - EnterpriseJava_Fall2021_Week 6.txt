ACCOMPLISHMENTS:  
Got a lot done on my project by getting the main code for some of the necessary classes completed. Bergan to get work done on the annotation for the database to
illustrate the different relationships between the tables and establish them in Hibernate for the Concept Compendium. Was able to get this material completed and have a 
good understanding of what was done. 



SETBACKS:  
I had a large one this week. I was still dealing with my illness that set me back several days. Once Paula had to check on me to find out if I was ok, or able to complete
the course, I needed to devise a plan to overcome these recent setbacks. I will need to cover all of the missed material in good time to get back on track. I am 
determined to take care of this so that this attempt at this class will be successful.
